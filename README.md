# Welcome to You Sunk My Battleship

<p>You Sunk My Battleshp is a tribute to the popular traditional game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)#:~:text=Battleship%20is%20known%20worldwide%20as,device%20apps%20and%20a%20film">Battleships</a>, the ultimate in simple strategy gaming.</p>
<p>Battleships can be played with just a paper and pen but it has grown into much more since it's inception during World War I. Now expanded to board games, electronic games and even a film, it is an enduring classic. This version offers a basic version in which the player must try and "sink" the ships on the board by guessing their position with a limited number of turns.</p>
<p>This game is a demonstration of my Python skills as required by Portfolio 3 Assessment as part of the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.</p>

## How to play
<p>Battleships are placed on a board and hidden from the player. They must guess where on the board they think the battelship is placed. First, typing a number corresponding to the x axis then hitting enter on their keyboard. This is followed by a letter corresponding to the y axis and the enter key. If the guess is correct, they have hit and sunk a battleship!</p>

<p>Players are limited to 8 torpedoes (or turns) in which to try and destroy all the battleships and win teh game.</p>

<p>If they are successful, they will be rewarded with a surprise display. If they run out of torpedoes, they will be prompted to try again in a new game.</p>

## Data Model
<p>For this game, two classes were used; one for the board and one for the ships. Using two classes for main elements of the game should allow for additional features to be added later without disrupting the way the game currently runs.</p>
