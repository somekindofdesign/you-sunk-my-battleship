<br>

## Intro
<p>A [classic game of strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)#:~:text=Battleship%20is%20known%20worldwide%20as,device%20apps%20and%20a%20film), Battleships can be played with just a paper and pen but it has grown into much more since it's inception during World War !. Now including board games, electronic games and even a film, "You Sunk My Battleship" is a tribute to the game that sparked a million little wars.</p>
<br>

## How to play
<p>Battleships are placed on a baord and hidden from the player. They must guess where on the board they think the battelship is placed by first entering a number corresponding to the x axis followed by a letter corresponding to the y axis. If the guess is correct, they have hit and sunk a battleship!</p>

<p>Players are limited to 8 torpedoes (or turns) in which to try and destroy all the battleships and win.</p>

<p>If they are successful, they will be show a little surpise. If they run out of torpedoes, they will be prompted to try again.</p>

### Direct code use:
<ul>
<li>[Python ASCII art using Pyfiglet Module](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-ascii-art-using-pyfiglet-module/) - this appeared to be the simplest method of inserting ASCII art into my project and there didnt appear to be a justification to change it</li>
<li>[Python Battleship with Object Oriented Programming by Knowledge Mavens through Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alJH_c9t4zw) - I was stuck on getting my game to execute and the solution came directly from this tutorial</li>
